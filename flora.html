                Flora refers to the plant life that is found in a particular region or ecosystem. It encompasses all 
                types of plants, including trees, shrubs, grasses, flowers, and mosses. Flora plays a crucial role 
                in maintaining the balance of ecosystems and providing essential services such as oxygen production, 
                carbon sequestration, and habitat for wildlife.
            </p>

                The study of flora is known as botany, which involves the classification, identification, and 
                understanding of plant species. Botanists study the characteristics of plants, their growth patterns, 
                and their interactions with other organisms in the ecosystem. This knowledge is essential for 
                conservation efforts and sustainable management of natural resources.
            </p>

                Conservation of flora is critical for maintaining biodiversity and ensuring the health of ecosystems. 
                Many plant species are threatened or endangered due to habitat loss, climate change, pollution, and 
                overexploitation. Conservation efforts include habitat restoration, seed banking, and legal protections 
                to prevent the harvesting and trade of endangered plant species.
